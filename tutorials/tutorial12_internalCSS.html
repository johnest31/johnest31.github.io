<h2 class="glow">History</h2>
    
<p><strong>Kratos</strong> is a Spartan warrior who rises to power as the God of War after defeating Ares, the original God of War. His journey begins when he is tricked by Ares into killing his own family, which leads Kratos on a path of revenge against the Greek gods.</p>

<p>In his quest for vengeance, Kratos destroys Olympus and the gods, including Zeus, his father. Later, the series moves to Norse mythology, where Kratos starts a new life with his son Atreus. He faces new gods and monsters, continuing his struggle to control his rage and redeem himself from his bloody past.</p>
