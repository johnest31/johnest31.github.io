A <font size=5><strong><em>shepherd</em></strong></font> boy in a village used to take his herd of sheep across the fields near the forest. He felt this job was very dull and wanted to have some fun.</p>  
    
    

<p style="margin-bottom: 50px;"align=justify>One day while <u>grazing</u> the sheep, he shouted, "Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is carrying away a lamb!" Farmers working in the nearby fields came running for help but didn’t find any wolf.</p>
The boy laughed and replied, "It was just fun. There is no wolf here."<font size=5><strong><em>The boy played a similar trick repeatedly for many days.</em></strong></font></p>  
    
    

<p style="margin-bottom: 50px;"align=justify>After some days, while the shepherd boy was in the field with the herd of sheep, suddenly, a wolf came out from the nearby forest and attacked one of the lambs. The boy was frightened and cried loudly, "Wolf! Wolf! <strike>The wolf is carrying a lamb away!"</strike></p>  
    
    
<p><font size=5 color=#7764a1> The farmers <sup>thought</sup> the boy was playing <sub>mischief</sub> again.</font> So, no one paid attention to him and didn’t come to his help.</p>
